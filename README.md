ECG Classification

This research-based project presents a hybrid model for ECG signal classification using CNN and LSTM for feature extraction, followed by SVM for final classification. Wavelet denoising enhances signal quality, while SHAP and LIME provide interpretability, making the model suitable for clinical use. Unlike black-box deep models, our approach emphasizes both accuracy and explainability. The system is modular, scalable, and designed to support trustworthy decision-making in medical applications, contributing to advancements in interpretable AI and biomedical signalÂ analysis.
